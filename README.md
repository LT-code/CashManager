orders issued by a terminal app on your android phone

## Documentation

### Purpose

The purpose is pretty simple, but the project itself will be quite a journey in learning
many aspects of application development: Oriented Object Programming, Mobile Apps,
Design Pattern, Code Coverage, Java Ecosystem and more generally developing robust,
reliable, multiple-uses code.

### UML

You can find the BDD schema and some diagram which explain the architecture of the project in [Documentation/UML](https://github.com/LT-code/CashManager/tree/dev/Documentation/UML)
